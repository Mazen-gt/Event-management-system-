In this part of the project we implemented the full registration and authentication flow for EventX. On the backend, we created secure REST endpoints using Express and Mongoose: a /register route that hashes passwords before saving users to MongoDB, and a /login route that verifies credentials and issues a JWT containing the user’s role. We also added middleware to protect routes and enforce role-based access, so only admins can reach admin-only APIs. On the frontend, we built a styled Registration page that collects name, email and password, automatically assigns the “user” role to new accounts, sends the data to the backend, and redirects the user to the correct dashboard (admin or user) after successful registration. This lays the groundwork for secure, role-based access throughout the application.
